# Mathematical Modelling of PI3K/Akt Pathway in Microglia

This is a home page regarding the MATLAB source codes for a novel biophysical model for cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in microglia where Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is mediated by both P2Y purinergic receptors (P2YR) and P2X purinergic receptors (P2XR).

This respiratory has two models as follows: 

## 1. P2Y<sub>12</sub> Model
It develops of a new IP<sub>3</sub>R (IP<sub>3</sub> receptor) model along with a complete biophysical model to capture human microglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> data from activation of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores consisting of SERCA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak channel.

## 2. PI<sub>3</sub>K/Akt Model
It builts a new PI<sub>3</sub>K/AKT model that uses a time dependant [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> profile to activate the PI<sub>3</sub>K/pAkt via CaMKII. This model supports that calcium influx via P2YR and P2XR can justify the experimentally observed twin peaks in the pAkt data.
